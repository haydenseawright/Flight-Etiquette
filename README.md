# Flight-Etiquette

**Question** Generall speaking, is it rude to say more than a few words to the stranger sitting next to you on a plane?

## Why I Chose the Question

I chose to create this chart, because people pass time in different ways; while some might prefer to get to know there neighbors, polite coversation could take away from other's in flight relaxation. As a result, I was curious if the general population considered this conversation rude.

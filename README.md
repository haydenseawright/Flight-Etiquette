# Flight-Etiquette

**Question:** Generally speaking, is it rude to say more than a few words to the stranger sitting next to you on a plane?

People pass time in different ways; while some might prefer getting to know their neighbors, polite coversation could take away from other's in-flight relaxation. As a result, I was curious if the general population considered this conversation rude.
